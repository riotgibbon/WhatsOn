Within just two years, she was a singing sensation at the top of the charts in Sweden.Along came husband Björn Ulvaeus and the phenomenal band Abba that engulfed the world in the 70s, featuring Agnetha\'s touching voice and striking looks. Agnetha lacked confidence on stage as the global demand for the group grew and grew, while being away from her young children caused her great turmoil. With special behind-the-scenes access to the making of her comeback album, the film follows this reluctant star - the subject of much tabloid speculation since she retreated from the stage post-Abba - as she returns to recording aged 63. Included in the film is her first meeting with Gary Barlow, who contributes a duet to the new album. The programme features interviews with Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, Gary Barlow, Tony Blackburn, Sir Tim Rice and record producers, Peter Nordahl and Jörgen Elofsson."},"images":{"standard":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01jy4mf.jpg","type":"image"},"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_one","titles":{"small":"BBC One","medium":"BBC One","large":"BBC One"},"attribution":"bbc_one"},"initial_children":[],"count":0},{"id":"b03z8wvd","type":"programme_large","lexical_sort_letter":"A","tleo_type":"series","title":"Aithne air Ainmhidhean/All About Animals","synopses":{"small":"Investigative guides revealing amazing facts about our favourite animals","medium":"Investigative guides revealing amazing facts about our favourite animals"},"images":{"standard":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01wlm07.jpg","type":"image"},"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_alba","titles":{"small":"BBC ALBA","medium":"BBC ALBA","large":"BBC ALBA"},"attribution":"bbc_alba"},"initial_children":[],"count":0},{"id":"b043kx7y","type":"programme_large","lexical_sort_letter":"A","tleo_type":"episode","title":"Alan Bennett at 80: Bennett Meets Hytner","synopses":{"small":"Sir Nicholas Hytner interviews playwright Alan Bennett on the eve of his 80th birthday.","medium":"Sir Nicholas Hytner interviews playwright Alan Bennett, ranging across 40 years of his work for stage, television and cinema, on the eve of his 80th birthday.","large":"Sir Nicholas Hytner interviews living legend and playwright Alan Bennett on the eve of his 80th birthday.

This poignant documentary charts the remarkable rise and fall of the snooker genius, from his early days growing up in Belfast to his climb to the top of the sport as two-time world champion. Higgins was pure showbiz, a mercurial talent at the table who played the game like nobody had done before. Boxing had Muhammad Ali, football was blessed by George Best - snooker had Alex Higgins. Yet like Best, Higgins\'s brilliance was flawed by his demons. We chart the depressing lows - the alcohol abuse, threatening to have fellow Ulsterman Dennis Taylor shot, headbutting a senior member of snooker\'s hierarchy and falling out of a top floor window and living to tell the tale after a row with his then-girlfriend. The Higgins story is completed with the final chapter of his life spent battling throat cancer; desperate hours spent in pubs and working men\'s clubs trying to rekindle his halcyon days; finally unable to eat properly because he\'d lost his teeth and in the end, ultimately found dead alone in sheltered accommodation.At times uplifting, but at other moments very sad - this is a rollercoaster journey charting the life of snooker\'s \'rock and roll star\'. Contributors include Jimmy White, Ronnie O\'Sullivan, Dennis Taylor, Barry Hearn, Steve Davis, Ray Reardon and members of the Higgins family."},"images":{"standard":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01gvtgv.jpg","type":"image"},"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_two","titles":{"small":"BBC Two","medium":"BBC Two","large":"BBC Two"},"attribution":"bbc_two"},"initial_children":[],"count":0},{"id":"b00ffbjg","type":"programme_large","lexical_sort_letter":"A","tleo_type":"series","title":"Alistair Cooke\'s America","synopses":{"small":"Alistair Cooke\'s personal examination of the history of the United States","medium":"Alistair Cooke\'s personal examination of the history of the United States"},"images":{"standard":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01l7wbw.jpg","type":"image"},"master_brand":{"id":"bbc_four","titles":{"small":"BBC Four","medium":"BBC Four","large":"BBC Four"},"attribution":"bbc_four"},"initial_children":[],"count":0},{"id":"b01bl2sy","type":"programme_large","lexical_sort_letter":"A","tleo_type":"brand","title":"All Over the Place","synopses":{"small":"Ed Petrie and friends find the most unusual, strange and amazing places to visit in the UK","medium":"Ed Petrie and friends go on a bizarre quest to find the most unusual, strange and amazing places to visit in the UK"},"images":{"standard":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01tw510.jpg","type":"image"},"master_brand":{"id":"cbbc","titles":{"small":"CBBC","medium":"CBBC","large":"CBBC"},"attribution":"cbbc"},"initial_children":[],"count":0},{"id":"b01cz0p1","type":"programme_large","lexical_sort_letter":"A","tleo_type":"brand","title":"Alphablocks","synopses":{"small":"The adventures of 26 lively letters who can make words come to life by holding hands","medium":"The adventures of 26 lively letters who can make words come to life by holding hands.
